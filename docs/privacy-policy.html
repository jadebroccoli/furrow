    <h1>Furrow Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Furrow ("we", "our", or "the app") is a garden tracking application. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the app accesses, how it is used, and what is stored.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All garden data you enter — including plant names, journal entries, photos, harvest records, season data, and preferences — is stored locally on your device. This data does not leave your device and is not transmitted to any server.</p>

    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p>Furrow requests access to your device's location solely to check local weather conditions for frost alerts. Your location is sent to the Open-Meteo weather API (<a href="https://open-meteo.com">open-meteo.com</a>) to retrieve forecast data. We do not store, log, or track your location. Location access can be denied or revoked at any time through your device settings; frost alerts will be unavailable without it.</p>

    <h2>Photos</h2>
    <p>Furrow accesses your camera and photo library only when you choose to attach a photo to a journal entry. Photos are saved locally on your device. They are not uploaded, transmitted, or shared with any server or third party.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>Furrow may send local push notifications for frost alerts, watering reminders, and care tips. These notifications are scheduled entirely on your device and do not involve any external push notification server. You can disable notifications at any time through your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Furrow uses the following third-party service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open-Meteo Weather API</strong> — Furrow sends your approximate location (latitude and longitude) to Open-Meteo to retrieve weather forecast data for frost alerts. Open-Meteo is a free, open-source weather API. Their privacy policy is available at <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/terms">open-meteo.com/en/terms</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services are used.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Furrow offers an optional Pro subscription through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple or Google. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>No usage analytics or tracking</li>
        <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>No financial or payment information</li>
        <li>No contacts or calendar data</li>
        <li>No location history or tracking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device using standard platform storage mechanisms. If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data — including plant records, journal entries, and photos — will be deleted.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Furrow does not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect personal data from any user, we are compliant with COPPA and similar regulations.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. If we introduce features that collect or transmit additional data (such as cloud sync), this policy will be updated before those features are released.</p>
