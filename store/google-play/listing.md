## Full Description (4,000 chars max)

Keep your garden organized — from the first seed to the last harvest.

Furrow is a simple garden tracker that helps you stay on top of what you've planted, when to water, and when frost is on the way. Add your plants, journal their progress with photos, and let Furrow handle the reminders.

How it works:
Add your plants and Furrow tracks their lifecycle — from planting date through expected harvest. Log journal entries with photos to see how your garden changes over time. When temperatures drop, Furrow checks local weather data and sends you a frost alert so you can protect what you've grown.

Key features:
• Track plants with name, variety, category, and planting dates
• Photo journal — snap progress photos and add notes as your garden grows
• Frost alerts — location-based weather checks with advance warning
• Season tracking — organize plants by growing season and compare year over year
• Harvest logging — record what you picked and when
• Smart reminders — watering schedules and care tips based on your plants
• Search, filter, and sort your garden by category, status, or name
• Works offline — all data is stored locally on your device

Free to use:
Track up to 5 plants and 1 season for free. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited plants, unlimited seasons, analytics, smart harvest timing, care tips, watering reminders, season recaps, and CSV export.

Furrow Pro is available as a monthly ($2.99/month) or annual ($19.99/year) subscription. Payment is charged to your Google Play account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime through Google Play Store settings.

Privacy:
Your garden data stays on your device. Furrow uses your location only to check local weather conditions for frost alerts. We do not collect, store, or share personal information. See our privacy policy for details.

Important: Frost alerts are based on publicly available weather forecast data and may not be perfectly accurate. Always check local conditions before taking action to protect your plants. Furrow does not provide professional agricultural or horticultural advice.
